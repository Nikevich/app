# Activity Place
This is my own project which help to students to optimize their job.

## Roles
There are several roles in the app that carry certain capabilities. <br/>
> **ROLE_STUDENT** - this role says that the user is a student and can perform custom functions. <br/>
> **ROLE_MANAGER** - this user has access to a wide range of user management functionality with the ROLE_STUDENT.
